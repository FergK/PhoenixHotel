# FINAL TODO

For each of the following tabs, we need the following:
Final code
Updated use cases
Updated sequence diagrams
Test cases

Refer to the previous documents for formats for the use and test cases.
Bhola didn't like the hand drawn style we used for the previous sequence diagrams, so you need to do them in word or photoshop or whatever you know how to use.

To claim a tab, please replace "No One" in that row with your name.

Let's plan on having this done by Mon, Nov. 28th so we can meet and assemble the final document.
