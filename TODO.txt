We need to decide who will be responsible for the following in Doc #6:

RTM - Fergus
WSD - Fergus
Gantt - Fergus
Source code (compiling and packaging for turning in)
Test Cases and rationale for test cases
COCOMO
Assembling and printing final document

==========

Some things to thing about when it comes to code formatting:

Classes should begin with capital letters
Method and variable names should be given in lowerCamelCase ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case ) for consistancy
It's better to spell out the full words in a variable name to make code more readable
examples: hotelRoom, isSmoking, roomReservation, billableItem
